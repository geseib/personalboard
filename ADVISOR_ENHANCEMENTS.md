# Personal Board of Directors - Advisor System Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive enhancement plan for the Personal Board of Directors advisor system to provide more intelligent, interconnected, and actionable guidance to users. The enhancements will be implemented as an optional "Enhanced Mode" that users can select, maintaining backward compatibility with the existing system.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Capabilities
- **Basic AI Advisors**: Skills, Goals, and Board Member advisors with structured responses
- **Simple UI**: AdvisorModal showing Questions, Recommendations, and Suggested Entries
- **Data Passing**: All user data is sent to advisors but not intelligently leveraged
- **Static Prompts**: Fixed prompt templates regardless of user's data completeness
- **Uniform Styling**: All guidance content is displayed with the same visual treatment

### Current Limitations
- **No Data Intelligence**: Advisors don't analyze completion state or data relationships
- **Limited Context Awareness**: Each advisor operates in isolation
- **No Prioritization**: No guidance on timing or sequencing of conversations
- **Basic Interactivity**: Simple "Add to Form" buttons without smart field targeting
- **No Progress Tracking**: Users can't track their advisory journey or see what's next

## Enhanced System Vision

### Core Principles
1. **Intelligent Context Awareness**: Advisors understand user's journey stage and adapt accordingly
2. **Cross-Sectional Integration**: Advice leverages data from all sections for deeper insights
3. **Progressive Guidance**: More sophisticated advice as users provide more complete data
4. **Strategic Timing**: System guides users to have the right conversations at the right time
5. **Actionable Intelligence**: Every piece of advice includes clear next steps and implementation guidance

## Phase 1: Intelligent Data Context System

### 1.1 Data Completeness Engine
```javascript
// Calculate completion scores for each section
const completionScores = {
  skills: calculateSkillsCompleteness(userData.superpowers),
  goals: calculateGoalsCompleteness(userData.goals),
  mentors: calculateBoardCompleteness(userData.mentors),
  coaches: calculateBoardCompleteness(userData.coaches),
  sponsors: calculateBoardCompleteness(userData.sponsors),
  connectors: calculateBoardCompleteness(userData.connectors),
  peers: calculateBoardCompleteness(userData.peers)
};
```

### 1.2 Relationship Mapping
- **Skill-Goal Alignment**: Analyze how current skills support stated goals
- **Board Gap Analysis**: Identify missing board member types for specific goals
- **Network Overlap**: Detect potential introductions between board members
- **Timeline Conflicts**: Flag competing priorities or resource constraints

### 1.3 Readiness Assessment
```javascript
// Determine advisor readiness based on data completeness
const advisorReadiness = {
  skills: completionScores.skills > 0.3, // Can give basic advice with some skills
  goals: completionScores.goals > 0.2 && completionScores.skills > 0.4,
  boardMembers: completionScores.goals > 0.5 && completionScores.skills > 0.6,
  strategic: Object.values(completionScores).every(score => score > 0.7)
};
```

## Phase 2: Enhanced Prompt Intelligence

### 2.1 Dynamic Prompt Templates
Replace static prompts with intelligent templates that adapt based on:
- **Data Completeness**: Different guidance for users with minimal vs. rich data
- **Goal Timeframes**: Urgent vs. long-term goal considerations
- **Board Composition**: Advice changes based on existing board member types
- **Career Stage**: Junior vs. senior professional considerations

### 2.2 Enhanced Skills Advisor

            key={rec.id}
            recommendation={rec}
            targetField={rec.suggestedField}
            urgency={rec.urgencyLevel}
          />
        ))}
      </section>

      <section className="conversation-tools">
        <ConversationStarters starters={parsedGuidance.conversationStarters} />

  content: "â†’ " attr(data-target-field);
  position: absolute;
  right: 8px;
  font-size: 0.8em;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

## Phase 4: Intelligent Guidance Engine

### 4.1 Conversation Timing System
```javascript
const conversationPriority = {
  immediate: [
    {
      type: 'skills',
      condition: 'hasGoalsButFewSkills',
      message: 'Define your superpowers before setting board strategy',
      urgency: 'high'
    },
    {
      type: 'goals',
      condition: 'hasSkillsButNoGoals',
      message: 'Set clear goals to guide board member selection',
      urgency: 'high'
    }
  ],

  strategic: [
    {
      type: 'mentors',
      condition: 'hasSkillsAndGoals',
      message: 'Ready for strategic mentor conversations',
      urgency: 'medium'
    }
