*Audio voiceover scripts for each slide*

## Slide 1: Title - Personal Board of Directors
**Background:** Slide2.png
**Duration:** ~45 seconds

Three years ago, I was stuck. I had a good job, solid skills, but I felt like I was running in place. Every door I tried to open seemed locked. Every opportunity felt just out of reach. Sound familiar?

Then a mentor of mine asked me a simple question: "George, if companies have boards of directors to guide their strategy and open doors, why don't you?"

That question changed everything.

Hi, I'm George Seib, and over the next few minutes, I'm going to show you how building your own Personal Board of Directors can transform your career – just like it transformed mine.

## Slide 2: The Challenge - 75% Feel Stuck
**Background:** Slide11.png
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

Here's the sobering truth: 75% of professionals feel stuck in their careers. Three out of four people are spinning their wheels, wondering why their careers aren't advancing faster.

But here's what I've learned: You can't do it alone. The most successful people in the world didn't get there by themselves. They had guides, champions, and strategic advisors helping them navigate every step of the way.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution - Companies Have Boards
**Background:** Slide12.png
**Duration:** ~25 seconds

Think about it: Every successful company has a board of directors. These aren't just figurehead positions. Board members provide strategic guidance, open doors, make critical introductions, and help navigate complex decisions.

If this model works for billion-dollar companies, why wouldn't it work for your career? The answer is simple: It absolutely does.

## Slide 4: Know Yourself First
**Background:** Slide11.png
**Duration:** ~45 seconds

Before you can build your board, you need to know who you are. This isn't about false modesty or imposter syndrome. You need to clearly define your superpowers – what makes you uniquely valuable.

Click "Open You Section" to start building your profile. You'll rate yourself across three categories: Technical skills like programming or data analysis, Business skills like strategy and communication, and Organizational skills like leadership and project management.

Rate each skill from 1 to 5 stars. Be honest – this isn't about perfection, it's about clarity. Your board members need to understand your strengths so they can help you leverage them effectively.

---

## Slide 5: Set Your Vision
**Background:** Slide12.png
**Duration:** ~40 seconds

Your board needs to know where you're going before they can help you get there. Click "Open Goals Section" to set your strategic objectives.

You'll define goals across three timeframes: Three months for immediate wins, One year for significant milestones, and Five-plus years for your ultimate career vision.

For each timeframe, write 2-3 specific, measurable goals. Instead of "get promoted," write "secure senior manager role in product development." Be specific about what success looks like.

Without this clarity, even the best board members can't provide meaningful guidance. Actually, you cant even pick the board members to add to your board. Give them a target, find the right board members,  and they'll help you hit your dream goals. 

---

## Slide 6: Map Your Network
**Background:** Slide11.png
**Duration:** ~25 seconds

Here's the exciting part: You already know potential board members. They're already in your orbit.

Look at your current network – colleagues, former managers, industry contacts, even friends in different fields. The key is identifying who could fill specific roles and provide the guidance you need.

You don't need to find perfect strangers. Start with people who already know and appreciate your work.

---

## Slide 7: Design Mutual Value
**Background:** Slide12.png
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

This isn't charity. The most effective board relationships are built on mutual value.

Ask yourself two critical questions: What unique value can you provide to them? And what specific guidance do you need from them?

Maybe you can offer fresh perspectives, industry insights, or help with their projects. In return, they provide mentorship, connections, or strategic advice. Great board relationships are always a two-way street.

---

## Slide 8: Essential Board Members
**Background:** Slide10.png
**Duration:** ~35 seconds

Every effective personal board has five essential member types, each serving a distinct purpose:

Mentors provide wisdom and strategic guidance through quarterly conversations.

Coaches help you build skills and improve performance, like a personal trainer for your career.

Sponsors are your champions behind closed doors, advocating for you in rooms where you're not present.

Connectors expand your network and facilitate introductions to key opportunities.

And Peers provide support, accountability, and collaborative growth as your career companions.

---

## Slide 9: Mentors - Wisdom & Strategy
**Background:** Slide7.png
**Duration:** ~35 seconds

Mentors are your strategic advisors. They've walked the path you're on and can help you avoid pitfalls while accelerating your progress.

Click the "Mentors" tab to start building your mentor strategy. You'll identify potential mentors by name, define what specific guidance you need from each, and plan your approach for reaching out.

Think about senior leaders in your field, former managers who've moved up, or industry experts you admire. The best mentor relationships involve quarterly conversations where you discuss long-term strategy, career decisions, and industry trends.

---

## Slide 10: Coaches - Skills & Performance
**Background:** Slide6.png
**Duration:** ~35 seconds

Coaches are different from mentors. While mentors provide wisdom, coaches provide hands-on development. They're your personal trainers for success.

Click "Open Coaches Section" to identify who can help you build specific skills. You'll list potential coaches, define what skills you want to develop with each, and outline how you'll work together.

Think about colleagues who excel in areas where you want to improve, training facilitators, or external experts. A great coach helps you build specific skills, improve your performance, and overcome immediate challenges through regular feedback and hands-on development.

---

## Slide 11: Sponsors - Influence & Advocacy
**Background:** Slide8.png
**Duration:** ~40 seconds

This is the role most people don't understand but desperately need. Sponsors are your champions behind closed doors.

Click the "Sponsors" tab to identify potential sponsors and plan how to earn their advocacy. You'll think about senior leaders who have influence in your organization, define what value you can provide to them, and strategize how to build these critical relationships.

They're the ones advocating for you in promotion discussions, recommending you for stretch assignments, providing references, and opening doors to opportunities you might never hear about. Remember: You earn sponsorship through exceptional performance and strategic relationship building.

---

## Slide 12: Connectors - Networks & Opportunities
**Background:** Slide4.png
**Duration:** ~35 seconds

Connectors are your bridge to new opportunities. They know everyone and love making introductions.

Click the "Connectors" tab to identify your network expanders. You'll list people who are naturally well-connected, think about what introductions might be valuable, and plan how to nurture these relationships.

These are the people who say, "You need to meet..." and then make magic happen. They expand your network exponentially because they see connections others miss. Great connectors help you reach opportunities that would otherwise remain invisible.

---

## Slide 13: Peers - Support & Accountability
**Background:** Slide9.png
**Duration:** ~35 seconds

Don't underestimate the power of peers. These are your career companions – people at similar levels who provide support, accountability, and collaborative growth.

Click the "Peers" tab to build your support network. You'll identify colleagues at similar career stages, both inside and outside your organization, and think about how you can support each other's growth.

Peers understand your challenges because they're facing similar ones. They can provide different perspectives, share resources, and help you stay motivated during tough times. The best peer relationships are built on mutual support and shared ambition.

---

## Slide 14: Your Network Is Your Net Worth
**Background:** Slide8.png
**Duration:** ~25 seconds

Here's the truth successful people know: Your network truly is your net worth.

Strategic relationships don't just accelerate your career – they transform what's possible. The right introduction can change everything. The right sponsor can fast-track your promotion. The right mentor can help you avoid years of mistakes.

This isn't networking for networking's sake. This is relationship building with purpose.
