## Implementation Notes
- Audio system automatically loads the correct file for each slide
- All 15 slides now have complete audio narration
- Auto-advance works: audio ends → 5 second pause → next slide
- Manual navigation disables auto-advance
- Play/pause button toggles between ▶ and ⏸
- Full presentation with auto-advance takes approximately 8-10 minutes

## System Status
🎉 **COMPLETE** - All audio files integrated and fully functional!
