# Quick Start Guide

Ready to build your Personal Board of Directors? This guide will get you started immediately with practical steps you can take today.

## 30-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Identify Your Superpowers (10 minutes)
Write down your top skills in three categories:

**Technical Skills**
- What specific technical abilities set you apart?
- What do colleagues ask you for help with?
- Example: "Python data analysis," "UI/UX design," "Financial modeling"

**Business Skills**
- What business problems do you solve well?
- How do you create value for your organization?
- Example: "Strategic planning," "Client relationship management," "Process optimization"

**Organizational Skills**
- How do you work with and lead others?
- What soft skills are your strongest?
- Example: "Cross-functional collaboration," "Mentoring junior staff," "Change management"

### Step 2: Set Your Goals (10 minutes)
Define one goal in each timeframe:

**Immediate (3-6 months)**
- What do you need to accomplish soon?
- Example: "Complete AWS certification" or "Lead the Q2 product launch"

**1-Year Goal**
- Where do you want to be by next year?
- Example: "Get promoted to Senior Developer" or "Transition to Product Management"

**5-Year Goal**
- What's your bigger vision?
- Example: "Become a VP of Engineering" or "Start my own consulting firm"

### Step 3: Map Your Current Network (10 minutes)
Look at your existing professional relationships and categorize them:

**Mentors** - Who gives you career advice and guidance?
**Coaches** - Who helps you develop specific skills?
**Connectors** - Who introduces you to new people?
**Sponsors** - Who advocates for you in meetings you're not in?
**Peers** - Who shares similar challenges and goals?

Don't worry if some categories are emptyâ€”that's what we'll work on!
