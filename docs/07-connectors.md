# Building Connections: Your Network Expanders

Connectors are the social catalysts in your network – people who know everyone and love making introductions. They have extensive networks across industries and are generous with their connections. In today's interconnected world, opportunities often come through relationships, and connectors multiply your networking capacity exponentially.

## What Connectors Provide

### Network Multiplication
Connectors exponentially expand your professional reach beyond your immediate circle. Instead of knowing 100 people, you gain access to the networks of your connectors, potentially reaching thousands of professionals.

### Strategic Introductions
Good connectors don't just make random introductions – they thoughtfully connect people who can create mutual value. They understand both parties' needs and interests well enough to make strategic matches.

### Market Intelligence
Because connectors interact with so many people across different companies and industries, they often have early insights into trends, opportunities, and market movements.

### Hidden Opportunities
Many of the best opportunities are never publicly posted. Connectors often know about opportunities through their networks before they become widely available.

### Cross-Industry Insights
Connectors who span multiple industries can help you see patterns and opportunities that people within a single industry might miss.

## What to Look For in Connectors

### Extensive Networks
Look for people who seem to know someone everywhere they go. They should have connections across multiple companies, industries, or functional areas relevant to your goals.

### Generous Spirit
The best connectors are naturally generous with their relationships. They enjoy making introductions and take satisfaction from creating value for others.

### Strong Reputation
Connectors should be well-regarded by their network. People need to trust and respect them for their introductions to carry weight.

### Strategic Thinking
Great connectors understand business and can identify opportunities for mutual value creation, not just social connections.

### Active Networking
Look for people who are actively engaged in professional communities, industry events, and networking activities.

## Building Relationships with Connectors

### Provide Value First
Before asking for introductions, look for ways to help your connectors. Offer insights, make introductions for them, or help with their projects.

### Be Specific in Your Requests
Instead of "Do you know anyone in tech?" ask "Do you know any VPs of Engineering at Series B companies focused on B2B SaaS?" Specific requests are easier to fulfill.

### Make It Easy for Them
When requesting an introduction, provide:
- Clear context about why you want to meet the person
- Your relevant background and credentials
- Specific talking points or mutual interests
- A suggested introduction message they can use

### Follow Up and Report Back
Always follow up on introductions and let your connector know how the conversation went. This shows appreciation and helps them understand what kinds of introductions are most valuable to you.

### Reciprocate Generously
When you can make introductions for your connectors, do so enthusiastically. Be generous with your own network to maintain the reciprocal relationship.

## Effective Networking Through Connectors

### Map Your Connector Network
Identify which connectors have access to different types of people and opportunities. This helps you make targeted requests to the right people.

### Expand Their Network
Introduce your connectors to each other when it makes sense. This strengthens your relationships and positions you as a valuable networker yourself.

When introductions lead to positive outcomes, share the news with your connectors. They take pride in successful connections and it encourages them to continue making introductions for you.
