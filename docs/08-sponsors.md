# Finding Sponsors: Your Advocates

Sponsors are influential people who actively advocate for you in rooms where you're not present. They go beyond giving advice to actually using their political capital and influence to advance your career. While mentors give advice, sponsors take action on your behalf, recommending you for opportunities and speaking up for your contributions.

## What Sponsors Provide

### Active Advocacy
Sponsors don't just offer advice â€“ they take action. They recommend you for promotions, nominate you for high-visibility projects, and ensure your contributions are recognized in leadership discussions.

### Political Capital Investment
Sponsors are willing to stake their reputation on your success. They use their influence and credibility to open doors that would otherwise be closed to you.

### Opportunity Creation
Sponsors often create opportunities specifically for you or ensure you're considered for opportunities that arise. They actively work to advance your career.

### Organizational Intelligence
Sponsors understand how decisions are really made in organizations and can guide you through political dynamics and unwritten rules.

### Executive Visibility
Sponsors help ensure that senior leadership knows about your work and contributions, increasing your visibility at levels that matter for advancement.

## What to Look For in a Sponsor

### Organizational Influence
Look for someone with real power and influence in your organization or industry. They should be able to make things happen and have their recommendations taken seriously.

### Belief in Your Potential
Sponsors need to genuinely believe in your capabilities and potential. They're willing to invest their reputation because they're confident you'll succeed.

### Willingness to Advocate
Not everyone with influence is willing to use it for others. Look for people who have a track record of developing and promoting talent.

### Aligned Interests
The best sponsorship relationships occur when your success also benefits the sponsor. Look for situations where advancing your career aligns with their goals.

### Strategic Position
Sponsors should be positioned to influence decisions that affect your career. This might be your boss's boss, a leader in your target function, or an executive in your industry.

## How Sponsorship Differs from Mentorship

### Action vs. Advice
- **Mentors** provide guidance and advice
- **Sponsors** take action on your behalf

### Relationship Dynamics
- **Mentorship** is often developmental and educational
- **Sponsorship** is transactional and results-oriented

### Risk Level
- **Mentors** risk little by giving advice
- **Sponsors** risk their reputation by advocating for you

### Reciprocity
- **Mentorship** is often one-way knowledge transfer
- **Sponsorship** requires mutual benefit and value exchange

### Duration
- **Mentorship** can be ongoing and informal
- **Sponsorship** is often tied to specific career transitions or opportunities

## Common Sponsorship Mistakes

### Asking for Sponsorship Directly
Don't ask someone to be your sponsor. Instead, build the relationship and demonstrate your value until they choose to advocate for you.

### Expecting Immediate Results
Sponsorship relationships develop over time. Don't expect immediate advocacy from new relationships.

### Not Delivering Results
Sponsors quickly withdraw support from people who don't deliver on their potential. Consistently meet or exceed expectations.

### Forgetting to Give Back
Look for ways to support your sponsors' goals and initiatives. Sponsorship should be mutually beneficial.

### Burning Bridges
If sponsorship doesn't lead to immediate advancement, don't become resentful. Maintain the relationship and continue performing well.

### Taking Credit
Never take sole credit for opportunities that sponsors create for you. Acknowledge their support publicly when appropriate.

## Navigating Sponsorship Dynamics

### Multiple Sponsors
Having multiple sponsors across different areas can provide broader support and opportunities. Don't rely on a single sponsor for your entire career.

### Changing Sponsors
As sponsors move roles or retire, you may need to develop new sponsorship relationships. Keep building your network of advocates.

### Sponsor Conflicts
If you have multiple sponsors with conflicting interests, navigate carefully and maintain integrity with all parties.

### Failed Sponsorship
If a sponsorship relationship doesn't work out, learn from the experience and focus on building new relationships.

### Sponsor Transitions
When sponsors change roles, they may be able to continue advocating for you in new contexts. Maintain these relationships over time.

## Reciprocating Sponsorship

### Future Sponsorship
As you advance, sponsor others who are coming up behind you. This builds goodwill and creates a positive cycle.

### Support Their Initiatives
Actively support your sponsors' projects and goals, even when it doesn't directly benefit you.

### Network Introductions
Make valuable introductions for your sponsors when opportunities arise.

### Public Recognition
Give credit to your sponsors when speaking about your career progression and achievements.

### Continued Relationship
Maintain relationships with sponsors even after they've helped you advance. These often become lifelong professional friendships.

## Global and Diverse Sponsorship

### Cross-Cultural Sponsors
In global organizations, having sponsors from different cultural backgrounds can provide valuable perspectives and opportunities.

### Diverse Representation
Seek sponsors who represent different demographics, industries, and career paths to broaden your opportunities.

### Pay It Forward
As you advance, sponsor people from underrepresented groups to help create more diverse leadership.

### External Networks
Build sponsorship relationships outside your organization through industry associations, alumni networks, and professional groups.

## Action Steps

1. **Identify Potential Sponsors**: List influential people who might be willing to advocate for you based on your performance and potential
2. **Increase Your Visibility**: Find ways to demonstrate your value to potential sponsors through high-impact work
3. **Align with Their Goals**: Understand what potential sponsors are trying to achieve and position yourself to help
4. **Build Trust**: Consistently deliver exceptional results and demonstrate leadership potential
5. **Be Patient**: Allow sponsorship relationships to develop naturally rather than forcing them

Remember: Sponsorship is earned through consistent high performance and strategic value creation. Focus on delivering exceptional results and building authentic relationships with influential people.

Sponsors can accelerate your career in ways that no other relationship can, but they require the highest level of performance and professionalism to maintain.
