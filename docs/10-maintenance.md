## Common Maintenance Mistakes

### Only Reaching Out When You Need Something
This is the fastest way to damage board relationships. Maintain regular contact and provide value consistently, not just when you need help.

### Forgetting to Update on Previous Advice
Board members invest time in giving you guidance. Always follow up on their recommendations and share the results, positive or negative.

### Not Acknowledging Their Contributions
Give credit to board members when their advice leads to success. Public acknowledgment (when appropriate) strengthens the relationship.

### Becoming Complacent
Don't assume board relationships will maintain themselves. They require ongoing investment and attention.

### Not Evolving the Relationship
As careers advance, static relationships become less valuable. Allow relationships to evolve and deepen over time.

### Taking Board Members for Granted
Never assume someone will always be available or willing to help. Treat each interaction as a privilege, not a right.

## Crisis Management

### When Relationships Go Wrong
- Address issues directly and professionally
- Take responsibility for your part in any problems
- Focus on solutions rather than blame
- Consider whether the relationship can be repaired
- Learn from the experience to improve other relationships

### When Board Members Leave
- Thank them for their contributions to your development
- Ask for transition advice to maintain continuity
- Request introductions to potential replacement board members
- Maintain the relationship even if formal board status changes
- Use the opportunity to refresh and evolve your board

### When Your Needs Change Dramatically
- Be transparent about your changing situation
- Explain how board members can still add value
- Ask for different types of support if needed
- Consider new board members for changed circumstances
- Maintain relationships even if immediate value decreases

## Technology and Digital Maintenance

### Digital Communication
- Use professional communication platforms appropriately
- Maintain updated contact information
- Share relevant content through social media
- Engage with their professional content online
- Use video calls for deeper conversations when geography is a barrier

### Online Presence
- Maintain a professional online presence they can reference
- Share relevant professional updates and achievements
- Tag and acknowledge them appropriately in social media
- Use LinkedIn and other platforms to stay connected
- Be mindful of how your online activity reflects on them

## Measuring Relationship Health

### Positive Indicators
- Regular, natural communication
- Mutual value exchange
- Growing trust and deeper conversations
- Introductions and referrals in both directions
- Comfortable asking for and providing significant help

### Warning Signs
- Communication becoming one-sided
- Lack of response to outreach attempts
- Feeling like you're imposing when you reach out
- No mutual value creation
- Relationship feeling purely transactional

### Relationship Audit
Quarterly assessment questions:
- Which board relationships are strongest and most active?
- Where am I providing the most/least value?
- Which relationships need more attention?
- Are there board members I should add or transition?
- How has my board helped me progress toward my goals?
